# Hello from simple example

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## This is a smaller header

Here is a paragraph with some content in it. Even if
=> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink links
are in a paragraph they should be on a new line in gemini.

### This is a level 3 header

Now comes a bullet list:

* Item A

* Item B with a link:
=> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron_collider Hadron collider

* Item C

### This is a level 4 header but should still be prefixed with '###' in gemini.

Now comes an ordered list:

* First item

* Second item

* Third item with a link:
=> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helianthus Helianthus

### This is a level 5 header but should still be prefixed with '###' in gemini.

Hello world.
